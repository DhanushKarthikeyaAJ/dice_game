# Dice Rolling Simulator

This is a basic Python program that simulates the rolling of two dice. It prompts the user to either roll the dice or exit the program.

## How It Works

- The program asks the user if they want to roll the dice by entering `y` for yes or `n` for no.
- If the user enters `y`, two dice are rolled, and the values of both dice are displayed.
- If the user enters `n`, the program prints a thank you message and exits.
- If the input is invalid (i.e., not `y` or `n`), the program notifies the user and prompts for input again.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your machine to run this script.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into a Python file (e.g., `dice_simulator.py`).
2. Run the program in your terminal or command prompt using the following command:

   ```bash
   python dice_simulator.py
